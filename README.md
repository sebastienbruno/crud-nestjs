# CRUD Nestjs

This NestJS API allows you to get informations about barcode through the Open Food Facts API.
The main services are protected by an authentification mode (json web token). 
The firts step is to register an user (/register). 
Then you have to log in (/login) with this user. In return of this service you will obtain a token. 
Finally you can consume with this token the API's services and get informations about product thanks to its barcode (/products/<barcode>).
